# LoravianInternalAffairs

This was a universal management bot for my, now disbanded, Roblox community. It features a fully functional Discord-Roblox verification system with role binding, similar to the likes of BloxLink or RoVer. The verification system was made using my Robloxdotnet library, which you may find here: https://github.com/Loravis/Robloxdotnet

## Verification demonstration
Step 1: A user runs the /verify command and is prompted to insert a phrase into their Roblox bio.

Step 2: The user pastes the phrase into their bio and presses the "Done" button. If the verification succeeds, they will see this:

Step 3: The user runs the /getroles command. If they have successfully verified, their server nickname will be changeed to their Roblox username and they will receive any server roles that they are eligible for.

## Note
There were some other features that I initially planned but never got to implement, which is why you may find some unfinished or not functional code in here.
